This project combines two initial independent efforts. Jeff Hammerbacher, Founder and General Partner at [Related Sciences](https://www.related.vc/), built a tracking spreadsheet. Separately, two journalists, Robinson Meyer and Alexis Madrigal, had built a tracker for [a story in The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-many-americans-have-been-tested-coronavirus/607597/). They came together March 7, and made a call for volunteers to help keep the data updated, tune processes, work on scrapers, and make a website.

The website and data are now maintained by a volunteer team of coders, journalists, data people, visualization specialists, analysts, and other people willing to help maintain this as a public resource, including:
