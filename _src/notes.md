For an overview of how our project works, please check [About the Tracker](/about-tracker). This page will dig into the specific data issues we’ve seen with various states, and document the data sources we’re using for each of them. 

## Here’s What We Know About States

As mentioned in [About the Tracker](/about-tracker), different states make data available in different ways. Below is a list of all the states with links to where they report information about test and case counts, and details about the data where it departs from how we’re trying to report it.

### Alabama

(<https://www.alabamapublichealth.gov/infectiousdiseases/2019-coronavirus.html>) 

Data is in text in the paragraph under the Cases and Testing header.

### Alaska

(<http://dhss.alaska.gov/dph/Epi/id/Pages/COVID-19/monitoring.aspx>)

### Arizona

(<https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/infectious-disease-epidemiology/index.php#novel-coronavirus-home>) 

We’ve combined the “Confirmed” and “Presumed Positive” numbers. Negatives are reported as “Ruled Out.”

### Arkansas 

(<https://www.healthy.arkansas.gov/programs-services/topics/novel-coronavirus>)

### California 

(<https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx>)  

We are currently carrying over an old number (690) for negative tests that we got by inferring from a total number we got through reporting on 3/7. This number is necessarily inaccurate, but less inaccurate than a 0 in that cell. For now, enter a 690 in the Negative column each update. 

Also, California has started reporting “positive cases” (133) alongside deaths (1). It’s unclear if the death is included in the positive case number. We’re not including it until we get further clarification.

### Colorado 

(<https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRSxDeeJEaDxir0cCd9Sfji8ZPKzNaCPZnvRCbG63Oa1ztz4B4r7xG_wsoC9ucd_ei3--Pz7UD50yQD/pub>) Colorado is providing the number of tests, not the number of people tested. That test count should probably be divided by two, per the rough rule of thumb ratio for specimens tested, but we will change this method once we find out more from CO.

### Connecticut 

(<https://portal.ct.gov/Coronavirus>)

### Delaware
(<https://dhss.delaware.gov/dhss/dph/epi/2019novelcoronavirus.html>)

### District of Columbia
(<https://coronavirus.dc.gov/page/coronavirus-data>)

### Florida
(<http://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/COVID-19/>)

We’re including both Florida residents and repatriated people from other states, but not the non-Florida resident(s). We’re assuming that the Deaths are included in the Positive Cases count.

### Georgia
